1. Which of these is a deterministic factor?
Options:

environmental variation – This is generally unpredictable and random, making it a stochastic factor.

forest fire – Usually unpredictable and random (stochastic).

death rate – This is a deterministic factor, meaning it directly affects the population in a predictable way.

diseases – While important, diseases can sometimes be random and sometimes predictable, but mostly considered stochastic.

Correct Answer: death rate
Explanation:
Deterministic factors are those that predictably control the growth, survival, or distribution of populations (like birth rate, death rate, or immigration/emigration). Death rate directly determines the population size and is not random, hence deterministic.

2. I tried growing vegetables under my teak plantation, but the vegetable plants died out. I should be concerned about
Options:

autophagy – A process where cells digest their own components.

allelophagy – Not a real term in this context.

autopathy – Refers to self-induced disease or injury, not applicable here.

allelopathy – The correct ecological term, where one plant releases chemicals into the environment that inhibit the growth of others.

Correct Answer: allelopathy
Explanation:
Teak trees release biochemicals (often from leaves or roots) that inhibit the germination or growth of other plants nearby — this process is called allelopathy.

3. The movement of lions across the Gir landscape is an example of
Options:

diffusion – Slow, gradual movement of a population from one area to another.

secular dispersal – Movement on a large evolutionary timescale (species evolving and spreading slowly over generations).

jump dispersal – Rapid movement across large distances (example: birds colonizing islands).

drifting – Passive movement (usually for seeds, spores, plankton).

Correct Answer: diffusion
Explanation:
Lions in Gir don’t suddenly jump to new locations or move through evolutionary timescales. Their movement is slow, steady, and local — matching the definition of diffusion.

4. "The geographical distribution of a species will be controlled by that environmental factor for which the organism has the narrowest range of tolerance." This is the statement for
Options:

Liebig’s law of the minimum – Growth is controlled not by total resources but by the scarcest one.

Liebig’s law of the maximum – Excess of a certain factor can also limit growth.

Shelford’s law of tolerance – An organism's success depends on the range of tolerance to environmental conditions.

Shelford’s law of intolerance – Not an officially recognized law.

Correct Answer: Shelford’s law of tolerance
Explanation:
This law explains that species distribution depends on environmental conditions. If a factor (like temperature or pH) is too high or too low — beyond the organism’s tolerance — the species will not survive there.

5. The regular, seasonal movement of animals, often along fixed routes is called
Options:

translocation – Artificial or human-made relocation of species.

migration – Natural, often seasonal, large-scale movement of animals (like birds flying south in winter).

dispersal – Permanent relocation, often non-seasonal.

drifting – Passive movement without control.

Correct Answer: migration
Explanation:
Migration refers to animals moving seasonally for breeding, feeding, or climate reasons. The routes are often fixed and repeated yearly.

6. Which of these is a stochastic factor?
Options:

birth rate – Predictable, deterministic.

death rate – Predictable, deterministic.

population structure – A static characteristic (demographic) rather than a fluctuating factor.

environmental fluctuation – Random and unpredictable; examples include sudden temperature drops or droughts.

Correct Answer: environmental fluctuation
Explanation:
Stochastic factors are random and unpredictable. Sudden environmental changes like storms, fires, or temperature swings are prime examples.

7. The movement of individuals away from their place of birth or hatching or seed production into a new habitat or area to survive and reproduce is called
Options:

translocation – Human-driven movement.

migration – Seasonal, often two-way movement.

dispersal – One-time, one-way movement to a new place.

drifting – Passive, usually for seeds or aquatic larvae.

Correct Answer: dispersal
Explanation:
Dispersal happens when individuals leave their birthplace to find a new area to settle and reproduce. Unlike migration, it is usually a one-way process.

8. Scarcity of food is a
Options:

chemical factor – Chemical factors are usually pH, salinity, etc.

demographic factor – Related to population size and age structure.

push factor – A reason that forces organisms to leave an area (e.g., hunger, drought).

pull factor – Attracts organisms to a new area (e.g., availability of food, water, shelter).

Correct Answer: push factor
Explanation:
A push factor is something negative that drives individuals away from an area. Food scarcity is a classic example — animals migrate or disperse to find better resources.

9. Which of these correctly represents the process of habitat fragmentation and loss?
Options:

Original forest → Dissection → Perforation → Fragmentation → Attrition – Correct order.

Original forest → Dissection → Attrition → Fragmentation → Perforation – Wrong order.

Original forest → Dissection → Perforation → Attrition → Fragmentation – Wrong order.

Original forest → Dissection → Fragmentation → Perforation → Attrition – Wrong order.

Correct Answer: Original forest → Dissection → Perforation → Fragmentation → Attrition
Explanation:
This is the natural sequence of how forests (or habitats) are broken down:

Dissection: Roads, canals, and clearings cut through a habitat.

Perforation: Small holes or gaps appear.

Fragmentation: Large patches are split into smaller, isolated ones.

Attrition: Remaining patches become too small and disappear entirely.

10. A root zone treatment plant is an example of
Options:

phytoremediation – The use of plants to clean pollutants from soil and water.

biological control – Using organisms to control pests.

biomagnification – Accumulation of toxic substances in higher levels of the food chain.

bioaccumulation – Buildup of substances in a single organism over time.

Correct Answer: phytoremediation
Explanation:
A root zone treatment plant uses wetland plants and their roots to clean wastewater. The roots absorb and break down pollutants — this is a classic case of phytoremediation.
